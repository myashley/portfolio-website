# Design Process
## Concept Development
The design process started with picking the keywords from my bio to drive as the main concepts throughout my design. 

I listed out some points about me:
- Quite but a little crazy / shy but a little adventurous
- Brain capacity: 1/3 logic, 1/3 creativity, 1/3 random
- Enjoy little things in life

Then worked out the keywords from above:
- Quite / Shy
- Crazy / Adventurous / Curious
- Enjoyment

With the keywords above, the colours options are as follows:
- Quite / Shy: White / off-white / light grey
- Adventurous / Curious: Red / Yellow (bright colour)
- Enjoyment: Light pink / light blue / light green (light colours)

## Inspiration
With the colour options in mind, I used Pinterest to find out colour combination that might suit my choices, and created a moodboard:

I also used Pinterest to find the layout ideas that are appealing and also be able to represent the "a little crazy" side of me:

### Colour
After the moodboard has been created, I used Palette Creator to create two colour palettes that suit my colour theme:

After a few experiments, the following colour palette has been decided:

### Layout

### Typography
Since the colours and layout are jumpy to represent the creative side of me, I would like the font choice to be more "logical": clear and simple to read, less is best.

Hence the Google font, "Roboto", has been chosen to be my main font throughout the website.
