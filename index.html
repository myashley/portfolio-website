                    <p>Ashley Tsai, a reader, a coder, and a little crazy about design. Her brain capacity divides into three parts: logic, creativity, and life enjoyment.

                            Currently studying programming at Coder Academy, proudly surrounded by a group of geeks mates who are also passionate about technology. She has two secret dreams: to become a full stack developer; and to shake an alien’s hand.
                            
                            Ashley has obtained qualifications in design, multimedia and business, and has previously worked as an e-commerce assistant, a web consultant, a web administrator, and a web content producer. 
                            
                            Though her career path stays mainly within the digital/web industry,  she also enjoys nature, walks her dog, and goes travel whenever she can.
                            
                            Bringing creativity into coding to make people’s life easier is what drives her passion forward. To learn, to create, and to give back.</p>
